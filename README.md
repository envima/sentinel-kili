Workflow for extracting vegetation indices from Sentinel L2A data for a user-defined study area and time period.

This workflow takes into account the specific cloud coverage of the study area and can thus also be used to select Sentinel-2 scenes based on the cloud coverage within a study area of interest.

An R-script for automatically downloading Sentinel-2 L2A scenes for a user-defined tile and time period is also provided.
